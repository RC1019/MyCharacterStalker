<p>Title: Stalkers bizarre adventures
Semester/Year: Freshmen 
Software: Photoshop, Audacity, After effects.<p>

<p2> My Final Project for this class is an animated short of a weird adventure that Stalker encounters during his travels. So basically the original idea was to create a classic duel inspired by old Clint Eastwood feeling. A fight to the death, but instead of I went for a comedic approach just like Charlie Chaplin. I created an animated short using photoshop (characters), After effects (scene and animation), and Audacity (Audio). These three were challenging to make at first because of being unexperienced with after effects but I got through it. The most fun I had in this project was definitely the Audacity. I don't know why but I feel like I could make more with Audacity. I could still incorparate a story rather than using visuals. It allows the listener to experience and use their imagination rather than being fed the information. The techniques I used were puppet strings, cropping, anchors, positions, and rotations to create my animation. The original idea was to create a turn-based shot like badass turn back and shooting back. However in the end I decided to scrap the entire thing and change the serious and grim tone to more of an enjoyable experience. I am excited to show you my beginner skills and how it can develop into something much more. I Also hope the audio was enough to made you laugh at least once or twice.<p2>
